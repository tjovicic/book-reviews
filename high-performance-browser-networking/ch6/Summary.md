# WIFI

# History
- 802.11 standards were primarily designed as an adoption and extension of the existing Ethernet standard
- Ethernet has CSMA/CD protocol for propagating signal and collision detection
- Wifi relies on collision avoidance CSMA/CA

# Packet loss
- TCP packet loss is often no higher on wifi than on most wired networks
- wifi hides retransmission and error correction from higher layers
