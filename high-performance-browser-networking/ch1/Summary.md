# Latency and Bandwith

Latency - time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it
Bandwith - max throughput of a logical or physical communication path

# Latency
- propagation delay: time required for a message to travel from sender to a receiver
- transmission delay: time to push packet bits in the link (nothing to do with the distance between sender and receiver)
- queuing delay: time for packet waiting in the queue 
- processing delay: time to process packet header

## Last mile latency
- significant delay is introduced in client-ISP part of the communication path

# Bandwith
- average global bandwidth is around 3 Mbps
  - almost enough to watch a HD video
- high-bandwidth link to ISP is desirable but not guarantee of a stable end-to-end performance
- we can always add more underwater cables but the speed of light is constant (bandwidth vs latency)
