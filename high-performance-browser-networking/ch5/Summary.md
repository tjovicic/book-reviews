# Wireless Networks

# Channel capacity
- maximum information rate
- depends on the bandwidth and ration between signal and noise(Shannon)

## Bandwidth
- overall channel bitrate is directly proportional to the assigned range

## Signal power 
- measure that compares level of desired signal to the level of background noise

## Modulation
- algorithm by which signal is encoded
- process of digital-to-analog conversion
